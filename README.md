# Rows or Columns? Minimizing presentation bias while comparing multiple recommenders.

this repository contains
- raw results of the user study (processed into .pkl with some sensitive attributes removed)
  - note that due to the filesize limitations, the file interaction_data.zip needs to be unziped first
- notebooks for processing the results analysing low-level and high-level feedback dependencies
- samples from the user study website (note that the study website cannot be published due to the anonymization, but it will be included after the review period)
