### Preference elicitation
**Select movies that you have seen and that you like.** It is advisable to select at least 5-10 films for the correct recommendation functionality.

Movies are selected by clicking on them and each selected movie is highlighted in green border. If you want to load more movies, you can use the button at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, you can use search bar at the top to search for movies that you know and like. This step will help us to identify and better understand your preferences. Let us mention that the newest movies from the database are dated back to 2018. When a mouse cursor is placed over a movie, its name and genres will be shown.
